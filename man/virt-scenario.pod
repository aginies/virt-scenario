=head1 NAME

virt-scenario - Create XML config and prepare host for a specific scenario

=head1 SYNOPSIS

B<virt-scenario>

=head1 DESCRIPTION

B<virt-scenario> prepare a libvirt XML guest configuration and the host to run a customized guest.
Idea is to use multiple B<templates> and concatenate them to create the
expected Guest XML file. If Host need a custom setting it will be done in second phase.

Customization to match a specific scenario is not graved in stone. The idea is to
prepare a configuration which should improved the usage compared to a basic setting.
This will B<NOT guarantee> that this is perfect.

B<virt-scenario> is only available in interactive mode.

=head1 CONFIGURATION

User can set some parameter in the B</etc/virtscenario.yaml>. This will
override the scenario setting (but will display the recommended setting).
